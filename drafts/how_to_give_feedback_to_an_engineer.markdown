# How to Give Feedback to an Engineer

(I'll give you a hint -- it's not down-voting, or one-liner emails)

**tl;dr:  Preface your constructive feedback with a compliment.  And end the conversations with additional positive feedback.**


First here is my FAVORITE clip of a boss giving his employee feedback

We engineers, for what ever are a sensitive bunch.  We are internally programmed to strive to get the acceptance of others.  Whether its gaining cread on StackOverflow, Getting up voted on Reddit, or more importantly when trying to impress your boss and peers.

We can take it as fact that giving and receiving feedback is a Good Thing.  

But if it is not presented well, it can have some unnecessary consequences.  What we want to happen is have the person receiving the feedback, process it and hopefully take it to heart.

What we do not want to happen is to make the receiver feel defensive or feel bad.

What works for me (and for others) is to wrap the constructive feedback with positive feedback.  So for example

> Jonathan, you clearly put a lot of work in defining that API.  It has some really great ideas in here.
> 
> But, I think you are trying to reinvent the wheel a bit.  I am sure I have seen this problem solved before.  Lets double click into before spending to much effort.  Good places to look are, xyz.
> 
> But again, I fundamentally I like your approach, partially xyz
